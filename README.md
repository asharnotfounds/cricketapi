# Cricket API Server

This Cricket API Server is a tool that provides programmatic access to cricket-related data, leveraging the [International Cricket Council (ICC) website](https://www.icc-cricket.com) as a primary data source. It allows developers to fetch information about teams, players, matches, rankings, and more, making it a valuable resource for creating cricket-related applications, websites, or data analysis projects.

## API Endpoints

The Cricket API Server exposes limited endpoints to retrieve cricket-related data. Here are some of the key endpoints:

+ `/all_fixtures`: Get a list of all upcoming fixtures.
+ `/mens_results`: Get a result of mens matches.
+ `/womens_results`: Get a result of women matches.

If you want me to improve this `Api Server` show some support then i'll for sure start working on it and come out with various endpoints to retrieve cricket-related data.
